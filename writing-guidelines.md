# Guidelines for Writing Content

## George Orwell

>### *"If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them."*

### George Orwell’s 6 rules on writing well.

#### 1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.

How many times have you been asked to…

>run it up the flagpole
>
>go for the low-hanging fruit
>
>think outside the box
>
>open the kimono?

Many business phrases are tired and overused; others are unpleasant. For clear communication, ditch the clichés and say what you mean.
 
#### 2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
Insecure writers dress up their language to hide a lack of knowledge. It rarely has the intended effect. A true expert will use a simple writing style to help the reader focus on content.
 
#### 3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.

#### 4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
Although the passive voice can be useful, it’s verbose and creates distance between writer and reader. For this reason, the best business writers prefer the active.

 
#### 5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

Technical language offers fast and precise communication for people in a particular industry. But it’s meaningless to everyone else. Consider your readers and express ideas in language they understand.
 
#### 6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Every piece of writing is different and no rules apply absolutely. If in doubt, remember the essence of Orwell’s message: think before you write.

### The Six Best Tips From <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well" target="_blank">‘On Writing Well’</a> by William Zinsser

#### 1.  Get rid of clutter.

“Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Re-examine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it’s beautiful? Simplify, simplify.”

#### 2. Write for yourself, not others.

“You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.”

#### 3. Study the greats - but also your contemporaries

“Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I’d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.”

#### 4. Think of writing as a process, not a product.

Many authors “know what they want to write, but instead of writing they say ‘Well, my main problem is figuring out how to find an agent and get it published. I tell them, ‘The main problem is that you need to write the damn thing.’”

#### 5. Read everything you write out loud for rhythm and sound.

“Good writers of prose must be part poet, always listening to what they write.”

#### 6. Have confidence in yourself as a writer.

“I go around giving my students permission to be who they are, and there aren’t enough people doing that,” he said. “You learn to write by believing in who you are.”

### Six Lessons Learned From Collaborative Writing

#### 1.  Writing is a team effort.

You will be writing as a team. Support each other with ideas and feedback. Write for yourself and write as a team. Work together to raise the quality of each others writing.

#### 2.  Ten thousand words will seem to many, then not enough.

In the beginning you may feel as though you need to fill the space with words. Once you pass the half way mark, things will change. Editing down will become your priority. How to convey all your ideas with so few words. 

#### 3.  Set a routine to write every day.

Write 250 words each day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. You will have written 10 thousand words. Spend the next 8 weeks making them perfect.

#### 4.  Write one idea at a time.

Write for each idea you want to convey individually. As your writing progresses these ideas will begin to form a narrative. One you may not have realized existed. Later revisit your manuscript to make this narrative clear to yourself and your reader.

#### 5.  Own a subject.

Don't divide effort by chapters, divide effort by subject. Work as a team to understand who has the most experience for a given subject area. If it is you, own that subject and become the leading voice throughout the book.

#### 6.  Enjoy criticism.

Criticism of your work is essential to improve as a team. Embrace criticism and use this as fuel to iterate the quality your writing. Beware, don't fall into the trap of writing to please everyone. If no-one hates your work, no-one will love it either. Always write with integrity.
