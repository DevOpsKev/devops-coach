This book was written by a team of talented agile practitioners and is the result of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source" target="_blank">innersource</a> publishing initiative from Tide Digital. This book is one of a series inspired by our mission to <a href="../../blob/master/disrupt-publishing.md">Disrupt Publishing</a>. This book and its contents are released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC 4.0</a> creative commons attribution license by Tide Digital APS Denmark who own the copyright thereof.

## Introduction

If you're interested in becoming a contributing author to this book please read our <a href="../../blob/master/writing-guidelines.md">writing guidelines</a> and <a href="../../blob/master/adding-content-instructions.md">instructions for adding content</a> to help you get started.

If you can't wait to be involved in this project and earn recognition as an outstanding Tide Digital coworker, read below.

## Bootstrapping your new career as an author...
###### The following instructions have been tested on Mac OS only. Should anyone want to update these to include Linux and Windows that would make you a beautiful person.

Before project setup you will need to have Git installed on your machine. If you do not have Git installed locally instructions on how to do so can be found here <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Getting Started - Installing Git</a>

### Project Setup for Mac OS

#### Step #1 : Get a local copy of the project
From the terminal navigate to a local directory where you want to work on this book and clone this repository using the following command. 

`git clone https://github.com/TideKev/agile-coach.git`

Your working directory should now contain a sub directory named 'agile-coach'. Congratulations, you can now contribute to this book and become both an outstanding Tide Digital coworker and famous published author.

#### Step #2 : Copy binaries to compile ebooks locally.

This project uses <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211" target="_blank">Kindlegen</a> to compile the ebooks in .epub format and .mobi format respectively. It is a good idea to review your local changes to the ebook in the appropriate format before submitting any change requests to the branch of the book you are working on. This will catch basic formatting errors and screw-ups early in the publishing process and is our first 'QA' of your changes.


You can follow the install instructions for both <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211" target="_blank">Kindlegen</a> yourself or you can follow the instructions below. Within the project we have included the executables for both Pandoc and Kindlegen. Primarily to ensure the project contained all the necessary tools to build the books without you having to hunt around on the Internet for external libraries. 

If you want to use the executables included within this project you can use the following commands to install those within your `/usr/local/bin` directory.

From your working directory type the following command

`cd ./agile-coach/`

You are now in the project root directory. Now type the following commands to copy the required executables to your `/usr/local/bin` directory. You will need administrator privileges on your machine to do so. You will also be prompted to enter the Administrator password.

`sudo cp ./Build/Compile/pandoc /usr/local/bin/`

`sudo cp ./Build/Compile/pandoc-citeproc /usr/local/bin/`

`sudo cp ./Build/Compile/kindlegen /usr/local/bin/`

#### Step #3 : 'Hello Publishing World!'

If all has gone well so far you are now set up to locally publish your first ebook. One small step towards acclaim, fame and fortune beyond your wildest dreams.

Ensure you are within the project root directory and execute the following command from the terminal.

`sh ./build-local.sh`

Using Finder navigate to /Build/Out/ from within the project root directory. Within the out directory you should find two files.

*'Agile Coach.epub'*

and

*'Agile Coach.mobi'*

Right click 'Agile Coach.epub' and select open with (Books). You should now be able to read the ebook!

Close the book view in (Books) and delete the book from your collection. This is recommended to avoid confusion relating to which version of the book you are reading as you begin to author content and review your changes before committing to the GitHub repository.

Next. Using the plain text editor of your choice, from the project root directory open the file:

`./Author/Chapters/000.md`

You should see this at the top of the file:

>`# Example Chapter.`
>
> `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.`

Just below where the file reads `# Getting Started` type your name or a unique message. Like so:

>`# Getting Started.`
>
>`Kevin Say's Hello Publishing World!`
>
> `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.`

Save and close the file `./Author/Chapters/000.md`.

Starting again from the project root directory, using the terminal run the following command.

`sh ./build-local.sh`

Using Finder again navigate to /Build/Out/ from within the project root directory. Right click 'Agile Coach.epub' and select open with (Books).

*Congratulations!*

You should now see your unique message at the start of the first chapter of the book.

Now delete those changes and put things back the way they were.

You are all set up to begin writing. Create your own branch on Github and work as you would normally. Submit any changes to your own branch and request those be merged to master as a pull request. It's that easy.
