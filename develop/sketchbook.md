# 1 : Agile is A Thing

* Agile with a capital A
    - defining qualities
        + adaptive vs predictive
        + Adaptive software development (ASD) is a software development process that grew out of the work by Jim Highsmith and Sam Bayer on rapid application development (RAD) - it may be time to rename this; I'm sure Jim and Sam would now be OK with that.
        + final paragraph set things up for not waterfall and Royce.
* Where agile came from 
    - Winston Royce
    - What is interesting is Waterfall is in fact not a thing at all?
    - Bell and Thayer
* What things were like before
* What things are like now
    - startups
* What things will be like in the future
    - Creativity will matter amongst all things AI will be good at the rest.
    - Individuals and interactions over process and tools.
* The role of the Coach in making this become a reality
    - Agile really is a people thing and not a process.


# 2 It's all about people
* Process abound, realise the point.
    - word one line one agile manifesto, top left. Individuals.
        * Creativity
            * a computer may beat you at chess (or Go) but a computer will never invent chess.
            * Computers do not dream
            * Computers do not love, or or fear anything. A computer will never cry at the transient beauty of a Sunset or feel overwhelming love at the site of a bird in the sky.
            * A computer would never risk its own oblivion to climber everest just because it is there.
            * Computers can not be inspired, because they are incapable of feeling inspiration.
            * People however, can make something out of nothing. 
            * Computers process information, people have ideas.


# 3 Agile Transformation
* This used to be the job
    - case studies and lessons learned

# 4 Agile Adoption
* This is the job now it has changed
* THis is harder as people have no point of reference 


# 5 Embrace The Learning Curve
* Shu Ha Re


/Section two - Methodologies

# 6 The Old School

    - The Scrum Alliance
    - Scrum.org

// sction 3 coaching

# 10 Coach yourself
* Coaching you leave an indelible mark on others. A tattoo artist always begins with their own hide.

* You are a coach. A coach is not a trainer. Coach has direct personal experience and applies to your context. Trainers deliver training consistently that adhears to an agreed format to ensure consistency.

# 11 Coaching The Individual
* one of the biggest differences is that coaching on an individual allows for private objectives.
* this is the most important level of coaching. This is fine level detail, high fidelity coaching. Allow the time to do your best work.


# 12 Coaching The Team
* we are looking for generalized specialists.
* Coaching and mentoring each other
* reverse mentoring from newbies.
* Constantly raise the bar on quality and don't be afraid to cut lose under-performing team members. But only if people demonstrate neither the will or aptitude to improve themselves.

# 13 Coaching The Organization
* play books are great, not because its a set of rules but because it makes people think through whart they are doing.
* Capture learning within the organisation, learning journals and knowledge bases
* line management by discipine, product discovery leads to set direction, squad/team leads should be coaches. Avoiding line management and delivery mitigates bias in personelle develop,ment. eg: 2 week training course more important than two week project deadline.

//edit out of first attempt at preface


No-one learns to be an Agile Coach on Twitter. It is impossible to obtain the skills required of an Agile Coach by reading 5-minute blog articles. Attending a 3-day course will not even begin to equip you with the experience necessary for the role. Some people I meet believe all these things to be true. Some of those same people even describe themselves as an Agile Coach.

Until now, when I have answered the "What do you do?" question with the reply "Agile Coach" my reply has been received with mixed response.

Most respond with puzzlement. These are the people with no previous experience or understanding of Agile as a method. 

From some the reaction is admiration. The people who have either had a positive experience working with a great Agile Coach, or at least understand the idea of what an Agile Coach might be. 

Occasionally I will be met with distasteful skepticism. From those with an idea of what an Agile Coach may be, and fundamentally disagree with it.

Before attempting to describe what an Agile Coach is let me first state some basic facts.

Agile Coaches don't come cheap, and good ones never arrive by the dozen. Depending upon how you engage an agile coach and their level of experience, an agile coach's presence alone may cost you anywhere between $600 and $6000  each day.

There is no mechanism to say that if someone has not earned an academic degree to Bachelors or Masters level, they cannot become an Agile Coach. An absence of these qualifications does not exclude someone from becoming a great Agile Coach.

Anyone can write a curriculum vitae that describes themselves as an Agile Coach when they have neither the expertise or experience to claim the title. No-one has ever been sued or legally reprimanded for doing so.

Professional certification of the Agile Coach role is disparate with organizations competing to have their certification recognized as the industry standard. Primarily for commercial self-interest.

There is no formal academic qualification to become an Agile Coach unlike other professions such as an Architect or a Doctor. Eligibility for the role of Agile Coach is more in line with that of a Management Consultant. Where although academic achievement to Bachelors or Masters level is a requirement, it is only a starting point for your professional development.

Capable Agile Coaches consistently demonstrate, when they work with motivated teams of talented engineers, those teams deliver products to market faster.  Faster than project managers attempting to stitch together the efforts of disconnected people by the application of a Gantt chart and unproductive status update meetings.

The Agile Coach is not a project manager. The role of the Coach is entirely different. A Project Manager's responsibility is to assure things go to plan, or at least align to a plan. The Project Manager is the guardian of the project process. An Agile Coach is far more focused on individuals and their interactions rather than process and tools. The primary objective for the Agile Coach is not to ensure people execute an agreed plan. It is to ensure they are principally equipped to respond to change.

A Project Manager ensures that activities align with an agreed process. A repeatable process or framework intended to manage all projects. The Agile Coach mentors people to adapt to their circumstances and meet the unique challenges they face. For the Agile Coach, everything is context specific. The chemistry of every team is unique, the problems that the team will face are unique, and the method that the team will develop to meet them will be unique also.

When you benchmark a product development or engineering team's performance using a well-considered set of performance metrics, that team's performance will *always* improve with the support of a capable Agile Coach.

Agile Coaches are in high demand, especially so in the fast-growing digital economy.  

The role of the Agile Coach is one of the most misunderstood professions in the digital industry and industry as a whole.

If you are involved in any way in the development of Digital Products and the delivery of those products to market, and if this book is your first introduction to the role of the Agile Coach. This book is about to make you significantly better at what you do.

Enough basic facts.

In writing this book, I want to share with you what I have learned as an Agile Coach. What that has taught me about myself. What I have learned from the teams I have worked with, and what I learned from the organizations we worked within. I do so because I want you and others like you to benefit from that experience. To build upon it in practice, and to make it your own.

That insatiable appetite for learning, improving and sharing is the at the core of what it is to be an Agile Coach. If you spend every working day learning, improving and sharing, it becomes more than routine. It becomes habitual. It changes you. And so, I now find I have to write this book. I cannot avoid it.

My reason 'why' for writing this book is that I value my profession. I want others to do so too, in more than monetary terms. My ultimate goal is to raise the bar. I want people to recognize a great Agile Coach when they meet one, and spot a fake. Not by inventing a new professional certification or by establishing some form of industry guild. I want to do so by creating a shared understanding.

I also want everyone, including you, to benefit from understanding the role of the Agile Coach. The disciplines of this profession apply to any context where people must come together to deal with complex problems or achieve the unknown. Many of these skills are intuitive. They are already within your mental vocabulary. It is the status quo attitude towards management and resource planning that have conditioned you to ignore them.

Other skills are counter-intuitive. They will challenge your belief in 'common sense.' That is what we are aiming for, a change in 'common sense.' A change in the accepted attitudes towards how we solve problems and how people work together to do so. 

Let me share with you some of the experiences that formed bonds which lead to some of the most valuable and rewarding working relationships of my life. When you build great teams, it is an unforgettable experience for both you and them. Those bonds of friendship and mutual respect will remain long after whatever project or product initiative you were working on is long since forgotten or obsolete. 

People with talent and motivation don't want or need management. They are capable, more qualified and better informed to manage themselves than anyone.

Instead, offer them coaching and mentoring to make the most of themselves. Offer those people the opportunity to learn from your own experiences without ego; for no other reason than to save them wasting their own valuable time. Save them the meaningless repetition of mistakes from which they won't learn anything of value. They will embrace the opportunity, for the simple reason they want to be better, they want to be their best.

Coaching is a form of leadership. It is leadership by consent. It is a model for leadership that depends upon experience and the will to share that experience with others. It is leadership expressed through education and mentoring — coach by example and lead by consent. Then let your teams discover their own goals and break through their own perceived limitations; your role is to make no objective unimaginable.

Start now. There is nothing to stop you from becoming an Agile Coach if that is what you want to be. You don't need to undertake a three-year degree or payout for expensive certification. You require the mindset and attitude, nothing else.

This book may be your first step, or you may already be on your way. If you are reading this book with the intention of becoming an Agile Coach or becoming a better Agile Coach, I hope you find value in what I share. 

I also hope you find as much reward in this occupation as I have done so myself. Give this everything you've got. This career pays back every day with compound interest, and it is not all financial. From personal experience, the richest rewards usually are not.
