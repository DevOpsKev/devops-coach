The title Agile Coach in itself is ambiguous. It contains two of the most commonly misunderstood words in the language of business. Neither is simple to explain. They are both open to interpretation. 

The first of these two words is Agile with a capital 'A.' Agile the noun. The name Agile describes a family of methods and ways of working that first emerged from Japanese approaches to knowledge-based product development and then evolved further within the software development industry. 

Adaptive may have been a more descriptive choice than Agile. There are reasons this book is not entitled Adaptive Coach; we will come to those later â€” simple human reasons. Agile is the name that stuck.

The role of a Coach is more widely recognized if broadly misunderstood. If you ask people to picture a 'Coach' in their mind's eye; most people can. They may envision a Football, Tennis, Executive or even Life Coach. 

Opinions regarding the value a Coach can bring to personal, and team development can run deep within people. When being coached people trust in their coaches abilities and intent. Great coaching inspires people to achieve their personal best. Poor coaching constrains learning and limits development in others. 

Experience of either can have a lasting and frequently emotional effect. Overcoming pessimism from those who have previously had a negative experience of coaching is one of the most significant challenges in my work.

To distill coaching down to its purest form, I would describe coaching as, the act of helping people to form new habits. Many successful coaches would agree. A coach guides others to establish new, positive habitual behaviors in themselves. 

Agile coaching is the act of establishing in others the habitual behavior of learning. The subconscious behavioral pattern to consistently learn and adapt, as fast as possible. Those we coach may be individuals or groups, sometimes the groups are large; that is when we coach organizations.

Another cause of ambiguity regarding the role of the Agile Coach is that this role in itself is evolving. The expectations of an Agile Coach's capabilities have now changed beyond recognition from when this role first emerged in the mid-'90s.

Agile in itself has evolved since then and must do so further. If anything, the accepted mainstream advice of Agile is now lagging behind the demands of the industry that led to its emanation. The principles of Agile uphold, but the broader context of technology-enabled product development has now changed to such a degree that the practices of Agile must adapt to remain relevant.

Among circles within the digital economy and the field technology-enabled product development Lean and Agile have taken some bad press of late. I attribute this to the need for revision of Agile practices and frameworks, some of which have now been established practice for over 20 years. This span of two decades has born witness to unprecedented rates of change and market disruption.

One of the most recognized Agile frameworks is the Scrum Framework. Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber co-authored the Scrum Framework. Scrum as a defined framework for software development was first presented publically by Ken Schwaber at the OOPSLA conference on 6 October 1995 in Austin, Texas. Kent Beck published Extreme Programming Explained on 8 October 1999.  The Agile Manifesto for Software Development was the result of a meeting of minds at the Snowbird ski resort in Utah between 11-13 February 2001. 

On October 21, 2001, Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle published Agile Software Development with Scrum and in so doing established the role of the Scrum Master as Agile Coach. The meme of the Agile Coach entered the collective conscious of the software development industry.

The title of this book is not 'Lean Coach,' I am not a Lean Coach. Lean Coaches do exist and Lean Coaching is a recognized field in its own right with established frameworks such as Six Sigma. Lean and Agile are not the same thing, although they share underlying principles. They share these underlying principles because both Lean and Agile can claim a common heritage. The lineage of both can be traced directly to Japanese manufacturing and product development.

Agile is an idea; it is a meme for rapid product development. Agile is a collection of principles. Together these principles describe an approach to product development that recognizes a fast rate of learning as the most significant factor for success in the development of products. 

Agile considers fast-learning optimal, as products are things 'made to be sold' for money. Less time spent in the development of those products is more money made and less money wasted. Slow-learning being sub-optimal as it is possible to run out of both time and money before you learn what it is that the people you hope will buy those products will, in reality, pay for.
